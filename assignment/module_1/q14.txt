 What are negative indexes and why are they used?

 Negative indexes in Python allow you to access elements from the end of a sequence. 
 They're handy when you want to conveniently access elements without knowing the 
 sequence's length. They simplify code by eliminating the need to calculate offsets
 from the end manually, making code shorter and more readable.
